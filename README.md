# React-Native Client Roster CRUD App (Work in Progress)

## I) cd into jsonserver folder
### a) npm install
### b) open two terminal windows
### c) in first window run: *npm run db*
### d) in browser go to http://localhost:3000/clientdetails
### e) in second window run: *npm run tunnel*
NOTE: In second browser, go to the forwarding address shown in terminal. (This address expires in about 8-hours so you'd need to repeat from step c if you try to use this app after ~8-hours).
### f) inside client-roster folder/src/api/jsonServer.js -- change the http address to the forwarding address from the last step.
